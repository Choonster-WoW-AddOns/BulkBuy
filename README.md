**Bulk Buy** is a WoW AddOn that lets you buy vendor items in quantities greater than a single stack using the default stack split frame (shown when you shift-click on a vendor item).

This includes both stackable (e.g. buying 50 Weak Flux, which stacks in lots of 20) and non-stackable items (e.g. buying 5 Mining Picks at once even though they don't stack).

There is no in-game configuration, but if for some odd reason you need to buy more than 10,000 of an item at once you can edit the MAX_STACK number at the top of the core.lua file to raise the limit.

Bulk Buy was inspired by an AddOn with very similar functionality I used a long time ago whose name I can't remember. I couldn't find this AddOn on WoW Interface or Curse, so I decided to recreate its functionality myself. Although the functionality is borrowed, the code itself is completely my own work.

You can download the AddOn from [Curse](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bulk-buy) or [WoW Interface](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info21442-BulkBuy.html).

You can find the latest alpha versions on [CurseForge](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/bulk-buy) and the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Choonster/BulkBuy).
