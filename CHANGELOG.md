## 1.09
- Fix stack overflow error when buying items for non-gold currencies

## 1.08
- Bump TOC Interface version to 8.1
- Update to account for 8.1 stack split frame changes
	- When buying an item sold in stacks greater than 1, the stack split frame will now allow you to buy any amount (like in older versions); not just multiples of the stack count.
	- The left and right buttons will now decrement/increment by 1 by default or by the stack count when the Split Stack modifier (Shift) is held.

## 1.07
- Bump TOC Interface version to 8.0
- Add .travis.yml file and TOC properties for the BigWigs packager script

## 1.06
- Fix bugs related to 7.2 merchant frame changes
- Change how items sold for non-gold currencies are purchased:
	- If an item is sold for a non-gold currency, the AddOn will now buy the largest multiple of the stack size sold by the merchant less than the amount entered in the stack split popup.
	- The previous behaviour introduced in 1.05 was to buy the stack size sold by the merchant multiplied by the amount entered in the stack split popup.
- Bump TOC Interface version to 7.2
